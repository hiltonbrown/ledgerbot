## Implementation Guidelines

### Tone Selection Logic

When generating business communications, analyse:

1. **Audience Level:** Executive, peer, subordinate, external client, regulator
2. **Message Purpose:** Inform, direct, persuade, support, enforce
3. **Relationship Context:** Established, new, strained, collaborative
4. **Subject Sensitivity:** Routine, concerning, confidential, contentious
5. **Cultural Context:** Australian business environment (slightly less formal, direct communication)

### Tone Blending

Most effective business communication blends multiple tones:
- **Primary Tone:** Dominant approach (60-70% of content)
- **Secondary Tone:** Supporting elements (20-30% of content)
- **Accent Tone:** Opening/closing touches (10-20% of content)

**Example Blend:**
- Formal report (primary) + consultative recommendations (secondary) + friendly closing (accent)

### Default Position

When context is ambiguous, default to **friendly-professional**:
- Accessible without being casual
- Maintains appropriate boundaries
- Suitable for most business contexts
- Easy to adjust up (more formal) or down (more casual)

### Australian English Considerations

- Use British spelling conventions (colour, realise, organisation)
- Incorporate appropriate colloquialisms sparingly ("arvo", "no worries")
- Maintain directness without excessive formality
- Balance professionalism with approachability

### Quality Checks

Before finalising any communication, verify:
- Tone matches audience and purpose
- Language is clear and unambiguous
- Message respects recipient dignity
- Call to action is evident (if required)
- No unintended subtext or implications

### Escalation Protocols

Adjust tone based on communication history:

2. **Follow-up:** Friendly-assertive
3. **Repeated issue:** Assertive-diplomatic
4. **Final notice:** Authoritative-formal
