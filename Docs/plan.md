# App Management Pages Plan

## Overview
This plan proposes a new settings section for the Intellisync app to handle user management features including usage tracking, user settings, file management, and integration settings.

## Proposed Page Structure

### Route Group: `(settings)`
All management pages will be organized under the `(settings)` route group for consistent routing and layout.

### Pages

1. **Main Settings Page**
   - **URL**: `/settings`
   - **Purpose**: Dashboard/overview page with navigation to sub-settings
   - **File**: `app/(settings)/page.tsx`

2. **User Settings**
   - **URL**: `/settings/user`
   - **Purpose**: User profile management, preferences, account settings
   - **File**: `app/(settings)/user/page.tsx`

3. **Usage Tracking**
   - **URL**: `/settings/usage`
   - **Purpose**: View usage statistics, API call limits, storage usage
   - **File**: `app/(settings)/usage/page.tsx`

4. **File Management**
   - **URL**: `/settings/files`
   - **Purpose**: Manage uploaded files, view storage, delete files
   - **File**: `app/(settings)/files/page.tsx`

5. **Integration Settings**
   - **URL**: `/settings/integrations`
   - **Purpose**: Manage API keys, connected services, third-party integrations
   - **File**: `app/(settings)/integrations/page.tsx`

## Implementation Details

### Layout
- Create `app/(settings)/layout.tsx` for shared layout across settings pages
- Include breadcrumb navigation and consistent styling

### Navigation
- Add "Settings" menu item to the user navigation dropdown in `components/sidebar-user-nav.tsx`
- Update sidebar to include settings access

### Components
- Create reusable components for settings forms, usage displays, file lists
- Follow existing UI patterns from the app

### API Routes
- Add API endpoints under `app/(settings)/api/` for data fetching/updating
- Examples: `/settings/api/user`, `/settings/api/usage`, `/settings/api/files`

## Next Steps
1. Create the `(settings)` route group directory structure
2. Implement the main settings page with navigation
3. Build individual feature pages
4. Add navigation links to sidebar
5. Test and integrate with existing authentication
