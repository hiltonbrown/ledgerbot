## Overview

Most teams and small businesses don’t want the hassle of deploying and maintaining infrastructure just to use an AI assistant. **Intellisync Chatbot** solves this by offering a **fully hosted version** that you can start using immediately. Simply sign up, log in, connect your accounting software, and begin chatting with powerful AI tools, managing documents, and collaborating with your team.

For developers, Intellisync can also be deployed locally or to Vercel for custom use cases—but the primary focus is on **end users accessing the hosted service**.

## Features

* 🔐 **Clerk authentication** for secure logins
* 🗂 **Persistent chat history** stored in the cloud
* 📄 **Document management**: create, edit, and share documents
* 👍 **Voting system** for messages and document suggestions
* 🎨 **Modern UI**: sleek and mobile-friendly
* ⚡ **Fast AI interactions** powered by the Vercel AI SDK
