## What is the Q&A Advisory Agent?

The Q&A Advisory Agent is an AI-powered assistant that provides answers to Australian regulatory and compliance questions. It searches a curated knowledge base of:

- **Fair Work Modern Awards** (employment law, minimum wages, conditions)
- **ATO Tax Rulings** (income tax, GST, superannuation, PAYG)
- **State Payroll Tax Guidance** (NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, NT, ACT)

### What makes it different from regular AI chat?

‚úÖ **Regulatory Citations**: Every answer includes links to official government sources
‚úÖ **Confidence Scores**: You can see how confident the AI is in its answer (70-100%)
‚úÖ **Australian-Specific**: Trained on current Australian tax and employment law
‚úÖ **Xero Integration**: Can cross-reference answers with your actual business data
‚úÖ **Human Review**: Low-confidence answers can be escalated to experts

### What it's NOT

‚ùå **Not a Replacement for Professional Advice**: For complex situations, always consult a registered tax agent or accountant
‚ùå **Not Real-Time**: Regulatory data is updated regularly but may lag behind very recent changes
‚ùå **Not Legal Advice**: This is informational guidance only

---

## Understanding Responses

### Example Question & Response

**Your Question:**
> "What's the superannuation guarantee rate for the 2024-25 financial year?"

**Agent Response:**

---

The Superannuation Guarantee (SG) rate for the 2024-25 financial year is **11.5%** of an employee's ordinary time earnings.

This rate applies from 1 July 2024. The SG rate is scheduled to increase to 12% from 1 July 2025.

**Key Points:**
- Employers must pay SG contributions at least quarterly
- The quarterly due dates are 28 days after the end of each quarter
- Ordinary time earnings include most payments for ordinary hours of work, but exclude overtime
- The current quarterly earnings threshold is $450 (employees earning less than this are still entitled to SG)

**Note:** This information is current as of the effective date shown in the ATO ruling. For specific situations or recent changes, please consult with a registered tax agent.

## Managing Settings

### Accessing Q&A Agent Settings

1. Click **"Settings"** in the sidebar
2. Select **"Agents"** from the settings menu
3. Scroll to **"Advisory and Q&A Agent"** section

### Key Settings Explained

#### Response Confidence Threshold (0-100%)

**Default: 70%**

This controls when answers are flagged for human review.

- **Set to 90%**: Only very high-confidence answers shown without review flag
- **Set to 70%**: Balanced - catches most uncertain answers
- **Set to 50%**: Permissive - see more answers without review flags

**Recommendation:**
- **Small business owners**: 80% (prefer higher certainty)
- **Bookkeepers**: 70% (balanced for daily work)
- **Accountants**: 60% (comfortable verifying answers yourself)

#### Knowledge Base Selection

Choose which regulatory sources the agent searches:

| Option | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **All regulatory sources** | General compliance questions (default) |
| **ATO tax rulings only** | Tax-specific questions (income tax, GST, super) |
| **Fair Work awards only** | Employment law questions (wages, conditions) |
| **State payroll tax only** | Multi-state payroll questions |
| **Custom documents** | Your own uploaded policies and procedures |

**Example:**
If you only do tax work, select "ATO tax rulings only" to get faster, more focused answers.

#### Hallucination Prevention

Controls how cautious the AI is:

- **Conservative** (safest): Only answers questions with clear regulatory guidance
- **Balanced** (recommended): Handles most questions while staying safe
- **Aggressive** (most flexible): Attempts more complex questions but less certain

**When to change:**
- Use **Conservative** for critical compliance work (BAS, payroll tax)
- Use **Balanced** for daily bookkeeping questions (most common)
- Use **Aggressive** for exploratory research only (not for client advice)

#### Human Escalation

**Default: ON**

When enabled, low-confidence answers are automatically flagged and can be escalated to human experts.

**Turn OFF if:**
- You're just exploring and don't need expert review
- You're comfortable verifying all answers yourself

**Keep ON if:**
- You're advising clients (accountants)
- Compliance mistakes could be costly (payroll, BAS)
- You prefer expert verification for important questions

### Regulatory Source Categories

These toggles show which sources are active in your knowledge base:

‚úÖ **Fair Work awards** (always on)
‚úÖ **ATO tax rulings** (always on)
‚úÖ **State payroll tax** (always on)

**Note:** These are system-managed and updated automatically. Contact your administrator if you need additional regulatory sources.

### Display Citations

**Default: ON**

Shows regulatory source citations below each answer.

**Keep ON for:**
- Client advisory work (accountants)
- Compliance documentation (bookkeepers)
- Audit trails (all users)

**Turn OFF only if:**

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Regulatory Stats Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Knowledge base shows "0" for all categories
- Message: "Knowledge base not yet initialized"

**Solution:**
1. Contact your system administrator or IT support
2. The regulatory knowledge base needs to be configured
3. See technical maintenance guide for setup instructions

**Temporary workaround:**
- Use general chat (not Q&A agent) for basic questions
- Manually search ato.gov.au and fairwork.gov.au

### Problem: Very Low Confidence Scores

**Symptoms:**
- Most answers show confidence below 70%
- Frequent "Review Required" flags

**Possible causes:**
1. **Your questions are too complex**: Try breaking into simpler sub-questions
2. **Knowledge base is outdated**: Check "Last updated" date in stats
3. **Question is ambiguous**: Rephrase with more specific details

**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Add more context to your questions
- ‚úÖ Ask about one topic at a time
- ‚úÖ If stats show "Last updated: 30+ days ago", contact administrator
- ‚úÖ Request human review for important questions

### Problem: No Citations Shown

**Symptoms:**
- Answers appear but no citation cards below

**Check:**
1. Is "Show Citations" toggle ON? (bottom of chat interface)
2. Does the answer say "No regulatory documents found"?

**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Turn ON "Show Citations" toggle
- ‚úÖ If no regulatory docs found, question may be outside agent's knowledge
- ‚úÖ Try rephrasing with more specific regulatory terms
- ‚úÖ Use general chat for non-regulatory questions

### Problem: Slow Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Answers take more than 10 seconds to appear

**Possible causes:**
1. Network connectivity issues
2. Complex question requiring multiple sources
3. System under heavy load

**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Check your internet connection

- ‚úÖ If consistently slow (>30 seconds), contact support
- ‚úÖ Try suggested questions to test if problem is question-specific

### Problem: Answer Seems Outdated

**Symptoms:**
- Rates, thresholds, or dates don't match current information

**Check:**
1. Look at citation dates (older than 12 months?)
2. Check "Last updated" in knowledge base stats
3. Verify on official government website

**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Click citation links to check official sources
- ‚úÖ If regulatory data is outdated, contact administrator
- ‚úÖ Note the effective date mentioned in the answer
- ‚úÖ For critical decisions, always verify on official websites

### Problem: Can't Request Human Review

**Symptoms:**
- "Request Review" button is disabled or missing

**Check:**
1. Is "Human Escalation" enabled in settings?
2. Is your user account authorized for review requests?

**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Go to Settings ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Q&A Agent
- ‚úÖ Turn ON "Human Escalation"
- ‚úÖ If still disabled, contact your account administrator
