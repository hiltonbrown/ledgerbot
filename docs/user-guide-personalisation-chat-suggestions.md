# Chat Suggestions - Detailed Guide

## Overview

Chat Suggestions are the 4 customizable quick-start prompts displayed on the main chat page. They provide one-click access to your most common questions and workflows.

**Location**: Main chat page (home screen) and Settings → Personalisation → Chat Suggestions

## What Are Chat Suggestions?

When you arrive at the LedgerBot chat page, you see 4 clickable suggestion cards. These are pre-written prompts that you can click to instantly start a conversation.

**Default suggestions** (before customization):
1. "What's my current cash position?"
2. "Help me reconcile my bank account"
3. "Show me overdue invoices"
4. "Explain GST obligations for this quarter"

**Purpose**: Save time by avoiding repetitive typing for common tasks.

## Why Customize Suggestions?

### Every Business is Different

Your most common accounting tasks may not match the defaults. Customize suggestions to reflect:
- Your daily workflows
- Your business type and industry
- Your role (business owner vs. bookkeeper vs. accountant)
- Your learning needs (if new to accounting)

### Time Savings

If you ask the same questions regularly, one-click access saves significant time:
- **Before**: Type "What's my accounts receivable aging report?" each time
- **After**: Click "AR Aging Report" suggestion → instant conversation start

### Team Standardization

If multiple people use LedgerBot in your organization, standardized suggestions ensure consistency in how people interact with the system.

## Best Practices for Writing Suggestions

### Keep It Concise

**Good length**: 3-8 words
```
✓ "Check today's cash position"
✓ "Review overdue invoices"
✓ "Help with month-end closing"
```

**Too long**: Truncates or wraps awkwardly
```
✗ "Can you please help me understand my current cash flow position
   including all accounts and upcoming payments?"
```

**Too short**: Not specific enough
```
✗ "Help"
✗ "Reports"
```

---

### Make It Actionable

Suggestions should clearly indicate what will happen when clicked.

**Actionable** ✓:
```
"Show AR aging report"         → Clear what you'll get
"Prepare BAS for Q2"           → Clear task
"Explain payroll tax"          → Clear topic
```

**Vague** ✗:
```
"Accounting"                   → What about it?
"Help me"                      → With what?
"Questions"                    → Too general
```

---

### Focus on Frequency

Choose your 4 **most common** tasks, not random examples.

**Ask yourself**:
- What do I ask LedgerBot weekly?
- What tasks do I repeat monthly?
- What questions do I find myself typing out repeatedly?

Use these as your suggestions.

---

### Use Natural Language

Write suggestions as you would naturally ask the question.

**Natural** ✓:
```
"What's my cash position?"
"Help me reconcile bank accounts"
"Show me today's sales"
```

**Robotic** ✗:
```
"Cash position query"
"Bank reconciliation assistance"
"Daily sales data retrieval"
```

LedgerBot understands conversational language - use it!

## Combining with Personalization

Chat Suggestions work **with** your other personalization settings to create powerful, contextual conversations.

### Example 1: Retail Business Owner

**Business Information**:
- Industry: "Retail office supplies, 3 locations, $2M turnover"

**Custom System Instructions**:
- "Always show GST breakdown. Flag transactions over $10,000."

**Chat Suggestions**:
1. "Today's sales by location"
2. "Check stock levels"
3. "Review overdue invoices"
4. "End-of-day cash reconciliation"

**Result**: Clicking "Today's sales by location" gives you:
- Sales figures broken down by your 3 locations
- GST breakdowns (from custom instruction)
- Comparison to previous days/weeks
- Context-aware retail terminology

---

### Example 2: Professional Services Bookkeeper

**Business Information**:
- Industry: "Professional services firm, 20 staff, client billing"

**Custom System Instructions**:
- "We use 6-minute billing increments. Remind about WIP adjustment monthly."

**Chat Suggestions**:
1. "Code this expense"
2. "Reconcile trust account"
3. "Generate client invoices"
4. "Month-end WIP review"

**Result**: Each suggestion starts a conversation that understands:
- Your billing method (6-minute increments)
- Your industry context (trust accounts, WIP)
- Your specific accounts (from Chart of Accounts)

---

## Dynamic Suggestions (Future Enhancement)

Currently, suggestions are **static** (you set them manually). Future enhancements may include:

- **Smart suggestions**: AI learns your common questions and suggests updating prompts
- **Contextual suggestions**: Different suggestions based on time of month (month-end vs. mid-month)
- **Role-based suggestions**: Automatic suggestions based on your industry/role
- **Quick actions**: Suggestions that trigger workflows, not just conversations

For now, manually customize to your needs and update as your workflows evolve.

---

## Managing Suggestions Over Time

### Initial Setup
Start with general, common tasks:
```
1. "What's my cash position?"
2. "Help me code this transaction"
3. "Show me overdue invoices"
4. "Quick accounting question"
```

---

### After 1 Month
Refine based on what you actually use:
```
Review: Which questions do I ask most often?
Update: Replace unused suggestions with frequent queries
```

---

### Seasonal Adjustments
Change suggestions based on business cycle:

**Tax Season (April-June in Australia)**:
```
1. "EOFY preparation checklist"
2. "Tax deduction opportunities"
3. "Prepare annual financial statements"
4. "Plan for next year's tax"
```

**Back to Normal (July onwards)**:
```
1. "Daily/weekly routine tasks"
2. "Standard reporting"
3. "Regular reconciliation"
4. "General accounting questions"
```

---

### Growth / Change
Update suggestions when your business changes:

**New location opened**:
```
Before: "Today's sales"
After:  "Sales by location"
```

**Hired a bookkeeper**:
```
Before: "How do I code this?" (doing it yourself)
After:  "Review transactions coded today" (oversight role)
```

**New compliance requirement**:
```
Before: General suggestions
After:  Add suggestion for new reporting requirement
```

---

## Limitations and Workarounds

### Limit: Only 4 Suggestions

**Workaround 1**: Choose your absolute top 4, use search/typing for others
**Workaround 2**: Rotate suggestions based on time of month
**Workaround 3**: Use one suggestion as a "menu": "Show me daily tasks"

---

### Limit: Suggestions Are Text Only

**Current**: Plain text prompts
**Future**: May include icons, categories, or quick actions

**Workaround**: Use clear, descriptive text that's easy to scan visually

---

### Limit: No Context Passed to Suggestion

**Current**: Clicking a suggestion starts a fresh conversation
**Future**: May pass context (date, current view, etc.)

**Workaround**: Write suggestions that are self-contained:
```
✓ "Show overdue invoices as of today"
✗ "Show these" (no context about what "these" means)
```

---
