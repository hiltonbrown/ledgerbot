# Accounts Receivable Agent - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This guide shows you how to use the AR Agent (`/agents/ar`) to reduce your daily workload managing customer invoices and collections.

**Time savings**: 15-45 minutes per day on invoice tracking and follow-ups.

---

## Daily 5-Minute Workflow

### Morning Check (3 minutes)

1. **Open AR Agent**: Navigate to Agents → Accounts Receivable
2. **Sync Data**: Click "Sync from Xero" button (30 seconds)
3. **Scan Dashboard**: Check three KPI cards at top
   - Total Outstanding → Know what customers owe
   - Active Debtors → How many customers to manage
   - Days Receivable Outstanding → Collection efficiency

4. **Quick Filter Review**:
   - Click **"High Risk"** tab → Review flagged customers
   - Click **"90+ Days"** tab → See critical overdue invoices
   - Note counts on each tab

**What to do**: If High Risk or 90+ Days show customers, plan follow-up actions for the day.

### Check for New Payments (2 minutes)

After customers pay invoices:

1. **Sync from Xero**: Click button to fetch latest payments

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Skip Daily Sync
**Why**: May follow up on invoices already paid (embarrassing!)
**Do**: Sync every morning and before sending follow-ups

### ❌ Don't: Use Wrong Tone
**Why**: Damages customer relationships or seems weak
**Do**: Match tone to situation (polite first, escalate gradually)

### ❌ Don't: Ignore High-Risk Customers
**Why**: Problems get worse, harder to collect
**Do**: Act immediately when risk score >0.7

### ❌ Don't: Send Follow-Ups Without Checking History
**Why**: May not know about disputes, payment plans, or agreements
**Do**: Always review customer details panel first

### ❌ Don't: Forget to Follow Up on Follow-Ups
**Why**: Customers may ignore if no consequence
**Do**: Track follow-ups, escalate if no response within 7 days

### ❌ Don't: Treat All Customers the Same
**Why**: Lose valuable customers, waste time on small accounts
**Do**: Prioritize by amount, risk, and relationship value

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| **Customer not in report** | Sync from Xero; check customer has outstanding invoices |
| **Risk score seems wrong** | Sync to update; new customers may have inflated scores |
| **Balance doesn't match Xero** | Sync from Xero; check credit notes allocated |
| **Can't find customer** | Use search box; check spelling |
| **Sync failing** | Reconnect Xero in Settings → Integrations |
| **Follow-up tone suggestion odd** | Review risk factors; override with appropriate tone |
| **90+ bucket has paid invoice** | Sync from Xero to update |
