# Dynamic Server Usage Warnings - Fixed

## Summary
Successfully resolved all "Dynamic server usage" warnings during production build by adding `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to routes and layouts that use authentication or dynamic data fetching.

## Problem
During the production build (`pnpm build`), Next.js 15 was attempting to statically generate pages that use dynamic functions like `headers()` (via Clerk's `auth()` function). This resulted in multiple "Error in getAuthUser" warnings for routes under `/settings/*` and `/`.

## Root Cause
The following files were calling `getAuthUser()` from [`lib/auth/clerk-helpers.ts`](lib/auth/clerk-helpers.ts:14), which internally uses Clerk's `auth()` function. This function calls `headers()`, making these routes inherently dynamic. Without the `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` declaration, Next.js attempted static generation, causing warnings.

## Files Modified

### 1. [`app/(settings)/settings/layout.tsx`](app/(settings)/settings/layout.tsx:7)
**Change:** Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
**Reason:** Layout calls `getAuthUser()` and `cookies()`, both requiring dynamic rendering
**Impact:** All child routes under `/settings/*` now properly render dynamically

### 2. [`app/(settings)/settings/page.tsx`](app/(settings)/settings/page.tsx:14)
**Change:** Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
**Reason:** Calls `getUsageSummary()` and `getFileSummary()` which may fetch dynamic data

### 3. [`app/(settings)/settings/integrations/page.tsx`](app/(settings)/settings/integrations/page.tsx:7)
**Change:** Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
**Reason:** Part of settings routes that inherit authentication requirements

### 4. [`app/(settings)/settings/usage/page.tsx`](app/(settings)/settings/usage/page.tsx:11)
**Change:** Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
**Reason:** Calls `getAuthUser()` and `getTokenUsageSummary()` with user-specific data

### 5. [`app/(settings)/settings/files/page.tsx`](app/(settings)/settings/files/page.tsx:8)
**Change:** Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
**Reason:** Calls `getAuthUser()` and fetches user-specific file data

### 6. [`app/(settings)/settings/personalisation/page.tsx`](app/(settings)/settings/personalisation/page.tsx:4)
**Status:** Already had `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` ✓

### 7. [`app/(chat)/page.tsx`](app/(chat)/page.tsx:10)
**Status:** Already had `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` ✓

## Verification
Build completed successfully with **zero** "Error in getAuthUser" warnings:

```bash
$ grep -c "Error in getAuthUser" build-verification.log
0
```

All routes now correctly show as dynamic (`ƒ`) in the build output:
```
├ ƒ /                                      180 B        1.21 MB
├ ƒ /settings                            29.4 kB         193 kB
├ ƒ /settings/agents                     12.3 kB         162 kB
├ ƒ /settings/files                       2.3 kB         149 kB
├ ƒ /settings/integrations                2.5 kB         116 kB
├ ƒ /settings/personalisation            6.71 kB         168 kB
├ ƒ /settings/usage                       114 kB         227 kB
```

## Technical Details

### Why `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`?
In Next.js 15, when a route uses dynamic functions like:
- `headers()` (used by Clerk's `auth()`)
- `cookies()`
- `searchParams` (as a Promise)

The route must be explicitly marked as dynamic to prevent static generation attempts during build time.

### Authentication Flow
1. [`getAuthUser()`](lib/auth/clerk-helpers.ts:14) calls Clerk's `auth()` function
2. `auth()` internally uses `headers()` to read authentication tokens
3. `headers()` is a dynamic function that requires server-side rendering
4. Without `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, Next.js tries static generation → warnings

## Best Practices Applied
1. ✅ Added `dynamic` export to all pages using authentication
2. ✅ Added `dynamic` export to layouts that call `getAuthUser()` or `cookies()`
3. ✅ Verified build completes without warnings
4. ✅ All authenticated routes properly marked as dynamic (`ƒ`)

## Impact
- **Build Status:** ✅ Clean build with no warnings
- **Performance:** No impact - routes were already dynamic at runtime
- **Functionality:** No changes - routes work identically
- **Production:** Ready for deployment with proper dynamic rendering configuration
